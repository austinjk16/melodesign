Reflection
One thing we learned was the process of coming up with an idea and executing it using coding. 
We learned it involved setting goals for ourselves and it was a lot more difficult than having 
a specification that you follow. Some of the things we enjoyed in the project was the creative 
freedom of what we got to do. Everyone in the group enjoyed music and played music growing up, 
so getting to work on a project about music was refreshing compared to assignments on the 
course that we may not have been as exited about. One thing we found frustrating was how 
difficult it was to combine different things we worked on and learning exactly how each other's 
programs worked. Something helpful that we noticed was commenting. Commenting allowed for a much 
easier way to understand how someone's program worked. It was vital in getting the project come together.
